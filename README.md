# Building a basic restaurant menu webpage using React and Bootstrap
Project that focused on transitioning from hardcoding HTML/CSS to JavaScript and React in order to dynamically render menu item components. 

## I learned how to properly apply Bootstrap's grid system, basics of passing props from parent to child, and deploying a react app to GitHub pages.
