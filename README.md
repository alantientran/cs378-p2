# Building a basic restaurant menu webpage using React and Bootstrap
Project that focused on transitioning from hardcoding HTML/CSS to JavaScript and React in order to dynamically render menu item components. 

## Skills I learned: how to
- Apply alignment using Bootstrap's grid system
- Pass props from parent to child
- Deploy a React app to GitHub pages
- Optimize the webpage by using React Fragments to reduce renderings
